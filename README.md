As a senior FullStack developer with over a decade of experience in web development, I create engaging, responsive websites that exceed user expectations and meet client needs, also, I consistently deliver high-value work based on my passion and expertise.

My focus is on creating clean, maintainable, and reusable code that is optimized for speed and efficiency.

I have a deep understanding of front-end technologies, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, React, Next.js, Vue and I'm also proficient in back-end technologies like Node.js, Nest.js, Python/Django, Ruby on Rails and PHP. 

As a goal, solution-oriented person, I always give my best and a little bit more because outside my limitations as an engineer is where I have found the most growth.
